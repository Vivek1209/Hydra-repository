Abstract on automation
Home automation techniques imbedded to Hospital
The world is heading towards men free trails which require no man power but only requires machine power. So, as a first step to modernization of hospitals, we took the project idea to imbed automation techniques in the field of hospitality. As the continuation to the project of Accident indication, I want to introduce this connectivity from to ambulance to each and every ward of the ambulance resembling the mode of emergency.
The intermediate alert would be from the GPS database to the nearby hospitals and the police stations so that it helps in minimizing the time of severity and the victim’s information will be sent to the required fields. The main theme of the project starts here.
The severity reports of the accident will be known by the hospital officials. It activates the ambulance and the route map will be sent to the imbed system in the ambulance. Clearly and genuinely saying, this thing was brought into existence by TESLA MOTORS and it works for the cars but we want to imbed this thing into ambulances.
Step by step review of the project in brief:
1.	Accident indication
2.	Information to the cloud(108 services)
3.	Route map to the ambulance(to make location most efficient)
4.	Automatic stretcher movement to causality ward
5.	Message indication to the doctor

this code is the basic code to control a rover using a cloud with their respective information and strategics…
